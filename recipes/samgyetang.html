  <p><em>Samgye-tang or "ginseng chicken soup" is a tang (Korean soup) that consists primarily of a whole young chicken (poussin) or quail filled with garlic, rice, jujube and ginseng.</em></p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cornish hens, each one weighting 1½ pounds</li>
    <li>½ cup short grain rice (or glutinous rice), rinsed and soaked in cold water for 1 hour</li>
    <li>2 fresh ginseng roots, washed</li>
    <li>2 large dried jujubes, washed</li>
    <li>16 garlic cloves, washed and the tips are removed</li>
    <li>2 to 3 green onions, chopped</li>
    <li>kosher salt</li>
    <li>ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds</li>
    <li>1 to 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon honey (or sugar)</li>
    <li>½ a medium size onion, cut into chunks</li>
    <li>1 Jalapeno (or green chili pepper), chopped</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Sesame dipping sauce: Combine 1 to 2 teaspoons of salt, sesame seeds, a pinch of ground black pepper, and toasted sesame oil in a small bowl and mix well. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Sweet sour soy dipping sauce: Combine soy sauce, vinegar, and honey (or sugar) in another bowl. Mix well with a spoon. Add onion and jalapeno. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Strain the rice.</li>
    <li>Remove the giblets from the hens and rub them with salt all over to clean them nicely. Rinse under cold running water.</li>
    <li>Put the hens on the cutting board, pat dry, and remove any extra fat around the body cavities with kitchen scissors. Cut off the tips of wings if you want.</li>
    <li>Stuff each hen with rice, 1 ginseng, 1 jujube, and 8 garlic cloves. Put any leftover rice in the pot.</li>
    <li>Place the hens into a heavy pot. Add 8 cups of cold water, cover, and cook over medium high heat for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>Turn down the heat to medium and cook another 40 minutes until the chicken, ginseng, and rice turn soft. Open up the pot from time to time and ladle some broth from the bottom over top of the chickens. If the broth evaporates too much, add more water.</li>
    <li>Remove from the heat.</li>
    <li>Place each hen into 2 individual bowls and add the chicken and broth. Sprinkle with chopped green onion and ground black pepper. Serve with kimchi, the 2 kinds of dipping sauce, and a small bowl of salt on the side for seasoning.</li>
    <li>If you serve them in earthenware pots, preheat the pots with a little water inside (about 2 tablespoons) and add the chicken and broth. Let them sit in on the heat until the samgyetang starts to sizzle. Then remove from the heat and sprinkle green onion over top and grind some black pepper. Serve hot with the dipping sauce, kimchi, and a small bowl of salt on the side for seasoning.</li>
