  <p><strong>In this classic lasagna recipe, sheets of pasta are layered with a cheesy filling, a rich meaty tomato sauce, and more cheese and then baked until bubbly and browned.</strong></p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Cheese Filling</li>
    <li>Meat</li>
    <li>Sauce</li>
    <li>Spinach</li>

  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large pot of salted water, boil lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce and simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
    <li>Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Spread about a cup of meat sauce into a 9Ã—13 pan. Add a layer of noodles.</li>
